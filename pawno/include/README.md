# samp-stdlib

The San Andreas Multiplayer Pawn Standard Library Package - designed for the [sampctl package management system](http://sampctl.com).

## Why?

The package management system built into the `sampctl` tool is based on GitHub (Simiar to that of the Go language) so it simplifies the process to have the standard library stored here on GitHub too. This means there doesn't need to be any special-case code written for the standard library, it can just be a package like all others.
